Currently only supports English and Simplified Chinese. Traditional Chinese will be added next.

**Notes**:

 - Responsive design is now implemented.
 - Uses PHP / MySQL / HTML5 / CSS3 / jQuery / jQueryUI / Javascript
 - Now has language-changing jQuery code 
 - Now supports cookies for saving language data.
 - Currently doesn't have Captcha.
 - Doesn't currently have pagination
 - You ***must*** have a database generated by Bible-Generator before this will be of any use to you.
 - You ***must*** set `$servername`, `$databasename`, `$username`, and `$password` in `classes/GlobalVariables.php` in order for this to work.
 - Supports Chinese dashes, `——` (double),  `—` (single), and English dashes (-). 
  - This is to maintain compatibility with Chinese Input Methods, which generally force two dashes when using the shift+dash button.
 - Some verses are *missing* in Chinese. 
  - **This does not mean they've been removed**: rather, the removed verse and the previous verse have been combined. This is because, apparently, some of these verses do not make sense on their own, and must be combined into a single verse. 
  - As far as I know, the words are still intact and have their same meaning. 
  - When this occurs, the missing verse is shown as, "**見上節**". 
  - This feature also helps to maintain backwards compability with English searches and processing, without needing lots of extra code.
- You do not need to change your language to search either English or Chinese. You may perform a search using either language, and it will be recognized.
